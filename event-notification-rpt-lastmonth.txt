Only 65% of the prescribed dose was administered. On April 5, 2019, the remainder of the prescribed dose was delivered to the patient.    There is no definitive cause identified at this time but the licensee has concluded that it was probably a delivery equipment problem (perhaps with the tubing).    The licensee will follow-up with a formal report.    * * * UPDATE FROM IRENE BENNETT TO HOWIE CROUCH (VIA EMAIL) ON 4/29/20 AT 1553 EDT * * *    The state of Georgia amended the original report to state that the deliver apparatus is awaiting decay to background and will be examined locally or will be sent to the manufacturer for a root cause analysis.    The prescribed dose was 127 Gy. The delivered dose was 59.8 Gy which is 47% of prescribed dose. As stated above, the patient was informed and returned two days later to complete the treatment.

The administered dose differed from the prescribed dose by more than 20 [percent].    "The prescribed activity to be delivered to the patient was 2.15 GBq (58 mCi).  The calculated delivered activity to the patient was 1.01 GBq (27.3 mCi).  The delivered activity was determined by comparing pre-and post-administration survey meter measurements of the administration equipment, as per standard TheraSphere procedure.    "Radiological Analysis:  Prescribed dose to target volume (liver): 127 Gy  Administered dose to target volume (liver): 59.8 Gy    "Discussion and Outcome:  On May 28, 2019, it was brought to the radiation safety officer's attention that a Y-90 TheraSphere administration had not delivered the full prescribed activity to the patient as intended.  Upon further discussion it was noted that the performing physician noticed after connection of the line between the micro-catheter and the delivery vial that multiple air bubbles had become trapped in the line.  He then created a closed system manifold using a three-way stopcock and syringes to effectively bleed out air bubbles and flush back as much of the dose as possible to the patient.  The closed system prevented any spillage or contamination, and residual dose was retained in the syringes and stopcocks.  Despite these actions taken by the physician, a post-administration assay of the waste container showed that the full desired activity had not made it out of the delivery equipment and into the patient.  The procedure was a segmentectomy, and [the] patient will be re-evaluated in one month's time to determine if an additional therapeutic administration will be needed.    "Root Cause:  Human error:  Air was likely trapped somewhere in the system during the initial setup of the equipment.  Operator technique failed to completely purge the lines of this air.  Air bubbles in the line were not visible or not noticed prior to the connection of the line.  Efforts to eliminate the air and deliver the full dose to the patient were then not successful.    "Corrective Actions and Actions to Prevent Further Occurrences:  The nature of this event and the likely cause has been discussed with all staff involved in these procedures.    "A refresher training session has been scheduled for staff involved in these procedures.  This training will be provided by a representative from BTG/TheraSphere starting on June 10, 2019.    "An additional step will be added to the procedure to visually and verbally confirm that there is no detectable air in the line between the micro-catheter and the dose vial prior to connection."    * * * UPDATE FROM IRENE BENNETT TO HOWIE CROUCH (VIA EMAIL) ON 4/30/20 AT 1323 * * *     The NMED report number from the original report was removed. The new NMED report number was not obtained. NRC Event number 54684 was also created for this event and was deleted from the database.

The licensee reports total dose 1.536 GBq, and 1.4 GBq to liver. Ultimately only 62.7 percent (75.3 Gy) of the planned dose was able to be administered to segment 6 of the liver. While attempting to administer the Y-90 dose to treat a lesion in Segment 6 of the liver there was significant resistance to flow. The AU evaluated the microcatheter system to ensure that there were no kinks along the catheter course external to the patient or visualized internally under fluoroscopy. The licensee believes the issue came from blockage at or before the 'E' site on the labeled tubing of the administration set, given that when it was disconnected from the microcatheter at that location, they were able to successfully flush the catheter. The patient then had a subsequent segment 7 segmentectomy using tubing from a box set from a different lot number without incident.

One of the owners, who is not an authorized user, took possession of four of the company's radiography vehicles and a sealed source was still in one of the vehicles. The source was subsequently retrieved, verified not to have been tampered with, and is back in storage.     The source contains 88 Ci of Ir-192.     North Dakota has notified their R4 Agreement State Officer (Erickson).     THIS MATERIAL EVENT CONTAINS A "CATEGORY 2" LEVEL OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL    Category 2 sources, if not safely managed or securely protected, could cause permanent injury to a person who handled them, or were otherwise in contact with them, for a short time (minutes to hours).  It could possibly be fatal to be close to this amount of unshielded radioactive material for a period of hours to days.  These sources are typically used in practices such as industrial gamma radiography, high dose rate brachytherapy and medium dose rate brachytherapy.

The report stated that the field user placed the probe into its case without securing its latches and locks and drove off to the next field site. It is believed that the probe had fallen out of the truck somewhere on Crows Landing Road between Carpenter Road and Ehrlich Road. The RSO [Radiation Safety Officer] had notified the California Highway Patrol (CHP) and the local Fire Department of the incident. Repeated attempts made by the RSO, his staff and CHP to locate the gauge were unsuccessful. The RSO will be posting a reward on social media for the safe return of the gauge. The RHB will be following up on this investigation.    THIS MATERIAL EVENT CONTAINS A "LESS THAN CAT 3" LEVEL OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL    Sources that are "Less than IAEA Category 3 sources," are either sources that are very unlikely to cause permanent injury to individuals or contain a very small amount of radioactive material that would not cause any permanent injury. Some of these sources, such as moisture density gauges or thickness gauges that are Category 4, the amount of unshielded radioactive material, if not safely managed or securely protected, could possibly - although it is unlikely - temporarily injure someone who handled it or were otherwise in contact with it, or who were close to it for a period of many weeks.

"The seed was implanted in a patient with a breast lesion at Piedmont Fayette on March 24, 2020. The lesion containing the seed was successfully removed in surgery and sent to the pathology lab on March 30, 2020. The presence of the seed in the specimen was verified in pathology by Neoprobe measurement. There was no pathology physician assistant present that day and the pathologist was not notified. A lab staff member arranged for all specimens to be shipped to Piedmont Atlanta. The specimens, including the one containing the seed, were shipped by MedSpeed courier service that same day. At the Atlanta campus, the specimen with the seed was processed by the normal procedure on April 1, 2020. The histotechnologist there removed what he thought was a marker or a clip and discarded it in the regular waste bin. The waste containing the seed was removed from the Atlanta campus [in a bag of solid waste] and transported to the [Pine Ridge Regional Landfill] by the waste disposal company's normal procedure on or around April 2, 2020.    "[The Radiation Safety Officer (RSO)] was notified by phone on April 3, 2020 and searches of all relevant areas at Piedmont Atlanta were performed by staff using a GM survey meter with pancake probe as well as with a Sodium Iodide scintillator probe that day. No evidence of radiation or the seed was found in any location.    "The proper course of action that should have been taken in order to prevent this situation is as follows: The pathologist at Fayette should have been notified that there was a specimen with a radioactive seed. The pathologist would have removed the seed and the pathology staff would have contacted Nuclear Medicine to retrieve the seed and place it in decay-in-storage. Seeds should not leave the Fayette Campus.    "In [the RSO's] estimation, it is unlikely that any occupationally exposed worker or member of the public received any significant exposure or exceeded any dose limit.    "All staff in pathology have been educated on the circumstances that led to this incident. The procedure has been updated to clarify what actions should be taken if a specimen with a seed arrives in pathology when no pathology physician assistant is present.

In November 2015, one of Schulz Electric's nuclear customers identified an issue with the adherence of the coatings.  In January 2016, the same customer reported another motor which had indicated coating adherence issues.  The lack of adequate adherence root cause was determined to be a contamination that was introduced to the oil reservoir surface through the use of a chemical chelating agent to remove rust from the endbells after cleaning.    On March 12, 2020 the same customer contacted Schulz Electric again to identify that two more motors had been pulled from service for standard overhaul and the bearing oil reservoirs for both motors had degraded coatings as well.  As such, Schulz Electric performed an extent of condition investigation and determined that there were additional customers for which Schulz Electric provided the bearing oil reservoir recoating.    The loss of adhesion and flaking exposes the bearing oil reservoir to oil and allows oil migration into the base metal.  Over time the safety related motors could degrade from the foreign material (flaking) concerns.    The licensees affected are Hope Creek, North Anna, Hatch, Farley, Vogtle, Grand Gulf, and Columbia.

It was unclear if the source train had actually entered the patient and the Agency requested confirmation and more information. On April 14, 2020, the licensee reported back to the Agency confirming that the source train had stopped moving after it had entered the patient. During the first attempt, the source train of 16 Strontium-90 sources in the Novoste device failed to go to the expected treatment position and instead got stuck in the beta-rail catheter proximally to the treatment area for 6 minutes 54 seconds. The device was checked and a second attempt was made during which the source got stuck in the beta-rail catheter proximally to the desired treatment area for 3 minutes 41 seconds. The source train was stuck at different positions in the catheter for the two attempts and each time the physicians worked with the catheter to try and get the source train to move to the treatment site. Doses calculated for each of the locations: first location = 26.2 Gy at 2 mm; second location = 14.2 Gy at 2 mm. The licensee was able to fully retract the source into the device each time.

MAY/MCY resistors are precision, low temperature coefficient, metal foil technology resistors used in circuits where stability with time and temperature is required. The RTL module uses this style of resistor to achieve its accuracy and variable temperature effects specifications. The symptoms exhibited by faulty resistors were open circuit or changes in value in response to physical or thermal stress. Faulty resistors were sent to the manufacturer for failure analysis. Cracks were discovered in the bond wires that connected the resistor leads to the resistor chip inside the resistor package.    The failure rate of resistors manufactured in 2017 and 2018 was significantly greater than resistors manufactured in earlier years. A search of the build records during that time interval resulted in three units. These three modules contain 10 kilo-ohm resistors with date codes from 2017. There are two 10 kilo-ohm resistors in an RTL module, R8 and R17, on the main circuit board assembly. Configured for an RTD input, only R8 is active. R8 sets the 1 milli-ampere excitation current for the RTD element. R17 is used in a voltage offset circuit that is only used in thermocouple and low level amplifier configurations.    If the module has been in service for any significant amount of time with no problems, 12 weeks or more, then it is probable that R8, the only suspect resistor in the default configuration, is not affected by this phenomenon. However, if the module has not seen significant service, then the module should be considered suspect. Additionally, if the module has been or could in the future be reconfigured to a low level amplifier or thermocouple application, then the same situation exists with R17, which is not used in the default configuration.

This notification is made pursuant to the reporting requirements specified in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) for an invalid actuation of one of the systems listed in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B).    "At approximately 1025 Eastern Standard Time (EST) on March 5, 2020, with Unit 1 shutdown in Mode 5 for refueling, an invalid actuation of Group 6 Primary Containment Isolation Valves (PCIVs) (i.e., Containment Atmospheric Control/Monitoring and Post Accident Sampling isolation valves) occurred. The invalid actuation occurred when power was lost as a result of the Inboard Isolation Logic Fuse being removed per a planned clearance hang to support maintenance.     "The PCIVs functioned successfully and the actuation was complete. The actuation was not initiated in response to actual plant conditions, it was not an intentional manual initiation, and there were no parameters satisfying the requirements for initiation of the system. Therefore, this event has been determined to be an invalid actuation.    "This event did not result in any adverse impact to the health and safety of the public."    The licensee has notified the NRC Resident Inspector.|

This switch senses when the mass measurement heads are separated and closes the shutter window on the radioactive source. There are two other means of determining whether the heads are out-of-alignment that also trigger the shutter window to close if indicated. Therefore, these additional layers of protection are adequate to protect against a radiation exposure if the heads are separated. International Paper has returned the system to service with the Honeywell recommendation to replace the switch as soon as the replacement part arrives. Per [the representative] of Honeywell, with the understanding that the failed component will be replaced, the customer can continue to keep the scanner under operation with the basis weight sensor."|

Penetration 37 will require repair prior to returning the vessel head to service. The indication was not through wall and there was no evidence of leakage based on inspections performed on the top of the reactor vessel head. The examinations were being performed to meet the requirements of 10 CFR 50.55a(g)(6)(ii)(D) and ASME Code Case N-729-4 to find potential flaws/indications before they grow to a size that could potentially jeopardize the structural integrity of the reactor vessel head pressure boundary.
